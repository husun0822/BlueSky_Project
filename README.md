Solar flares is a sudden flash of increased brightness on the Sun, usually observed near its surface and in close proximity to a sunspot group.  It can strongly influence the space weather condition around the Earth via generating streams of highly energetic particles in the solar wind that may impact Earth's magnetosphere.

Predictions of solar flares is critical for safeguarding our technological infrastructure. Extreme space storms -- those that could significantly degrade critical infrastructure -- could disable large portions of the electrical power grid, resulting in cascading failures that would affect key services such as water supply, health care, and transportation, and cost trillions of dollars.

In this research, we utilized Sun's image data and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model for predicting this type of rare astrophysics event.

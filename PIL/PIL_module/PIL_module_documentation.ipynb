All positive/negative pixels of the image are ranked in an ascending order based on the magnitude of the vertical magnetic field. And only pixels lying on the top quantile will be considered as \"strong\" pixels. Setting the threshold close to 1 means only defining the very top few pixels with the largest vertical magnetic field component. \n",

For each pixel, its neighborhood is defined as a square shape subimage of the original image that has the pixel of interest locating at the center of the subimage. Window_size is the length of the side of the subimage. This subimage includes several adjacent pixels which are considered as the \"neighbors\" of the pixel.

After edge detection, the algorithm finally filters a set of pixels to draw the polarity inversion line. For two points to be considered as consisting of the same PIL, they must be reachable from each other in the sense that there is a path of core points along which any two points on the path has a distance less than radius.

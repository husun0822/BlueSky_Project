    "       In a pixelized image, the pixels that consist of the PIL should be those pixels that have a large Bz gradient in \n",

    "       So by applying an edge detection filter upon each Bz image, we could find the candidate pixels of the PIL. And by \n",
    "       further applying a clustering algorithm on the candidate pixels, we are able to locate several PIL segments in the\n",
